# House Card Project

This project was created with React.

In the project directory, you can run:

1. yarn install: to install all yarn dependencies to run the project.
2. yarn start: to run the entire project.

Basically I tried to separate the code in components and some code that I could reuse.
Tried to split the logic because in the future could be more easy to test.
And I also tried to added some useful logic in a hook, using the tools that React offers and control the fetch logic.
